# DAO Treasury â€” System Overview for LLMs & Technical Contributors

## Project Purpose

DAO Treasury is a modular, extensible analytics and reporting system for decentralized organizations. It ingests on-chain data, models and categorizes transactions, and provides professional dashboards for financial transparency and decision-making.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Model & Persistence

- **Pony ORM**: Defines entities for chains, addresses, tokens, transaction groups, treasury transactions, streams, and streamed funds.
- **SQL Views**: Created for reporting/analytics (e.g., general ledger, stream ledger, monthly PnL).
- **Extensible**: New entities/relationships can be added by following ORM/view patterns.

### 2. Wallet Management

- **TreasuryWallet**: Dataclass for DAO wallet addresses, with metadata (start/end block/timestamp, networks).
- **YAML Loader**: Supports advanced wallet configuration via YAML.

### 3. Transaction Ingestion

- **LedgerEntry**: Ingests on-chain transactions using eth-portfolio and Brownie.
- **Async Processing**: Uses a_sync and thread pools for efficient, non-blocking ingestion.

### 4. Sorting & Categorization

- **Static & Dynamic Rules**: Attribute-based (e.g., address, hash) and function/decorator-based (custom logic).
- **YAML Rules**: External, declarative rules loaded at runtime.
- **Matchers**: Fast lookup for from/to address and hash-based categorization.
- **Factories**: Decorator/factory pattern for registering new rules.
- **Extensible**: Add new rules via code or YAML.

### 5. Streams (LlamaPay & More)

- **LlamaPayProcessor**: Handles streaming payments, processes on-chain events, and amortizes streams for analytics.
- **Extensible**: Add new streaming protocols by following the established pattern.

### 6. Dashboarding & Analytics

- **Grafana**: Dashboards provisioned via JSON, orchestrated with Docker Compose.
- **Renderer**: Optional container for exporting dashboards as images.
- **Persistent Storage**: All dashboard data/settings are persisted.

## Data Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant CLI
    participant WalletLoader
    participant Portfolio
    participant DB
    participant Sorter
    participant Grafana

    User->>CLI: Run dao-treasury (with wallets, rules, etc.)
    CLI->>WalletLoader: Load wallets (YAML or CLI)
    WalletLoader->>Portfolio: Initialize ExportablePortfolio
    Portfolio->>DB: Stream ledger entries, insert transactions
    DB->>Sorter: Categorize transactions (static/dynamic/YAML)
    Sorter->>DB: Update txgroup/category
    DB->>Grafana: Expose SQL views for dashboards
    Grafana->>User: Display dashboards/analytics
```

## Extensibility

- **Add a new sort rule**: Use a factory (e.g., `@expense("Gas")`) or add to YAML.
- **Add a new dashboard**: Create/export JSON in Grafana, place in provisioning directory.
- **Add a new stream protocol**: Implement a processor class, register in streams module.
- **Add a new entity**: Define ORM class, update views as needed.

---

## Key Technical Patterns

- **Type Safety**: Extensive use of type hints and `Final`.
- **Async**: Async processing for ingestion and streaming.
- **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns, extensible via factories and YAML.
- **Testing**: pytest and mypy for quality.
- **Performance**: Critical modules and constants are compiled with [mypyc](https://mypyc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for C-level speed. All constants are marked with `Final`, enabling mypyc to generate extremely fast, immutable C constants at runtime. Contributors should use `Final` for any new constants to maximize performance.
- **Security**: Secrets via environment variables, explicit error handling.

**For LLMs:**  
All categorization, reporting, and analytics logic is discoverable via the sorting subsystem and SQL views. For code generation or refactoring, follow the established patterns in the ORM, sorting, and dashboard provisioning modules.
